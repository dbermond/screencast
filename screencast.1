.SH NAME
\fBscreencast\fR - command line interface to record a X11 desktop
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBscreencast\fR [\fIoptions\fR] output
\fBscreencast\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-u\fR
.fi
.PP
The specified output filename must have an extension which in turn must be a
supported container format.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBscreencast\fR is a command line interface to record a X11 desktop using
FFmpeg, having support for offline recording and live streaming. It\'s
designed to make desktop recording a simple task, eliminating the somewhat
complex FFmpeg command line arguments and the need of multiple commands. It
uses predefined encoder settings that should be suitable for most needs. The
default settings provides a quick and affordable way to record the desktop and
is YouTube ready, letting the user to be focused on just specifying the
desired video size (resolution) and position. If the user doesn\'t want to
stick with the default settings, it is possible to choose among a set of
supported encoders and container formats.
.PP
\fBscreencast\fR not only provides an easy way to record your desktop, but it
also has options to automatically add some effects to the recordings, like
video fade-in / fade-out, text watermarking, webcam overlay  and volume
increase.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBOptions usage notes:\fR
.RS
.PP
The default setting will be used for any option that is not specified. You do
not need to specify an option if you want to use its default value.
.PP
Long options can be used with spaces or an equal sign (\'=\'). For example,
\fB\-\-fade \fIin\fR is the same as \fB\-\-fade\fR=\fIin\fR.
.PP
Short options cannot be combined in UNIX style. For example,
\'$ \fBscreencast \-unx\fI60\fR\' cannot be used and should be entered as
\'$ \fBscreencast \-u \-n \-x \fI60\fR\'.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-size\fR=\fIN\fRx\fIN\fR
.RS
The video size. This is actually the video resolution (width x height).
Combined with \fB\-p\fR option it will define a rectangular desktop area that
will be recorded. This rectangular area must be inside of the current screen
size/resolution (cannot be out of screen bounds).
.PP
Both the width and height specified in video size must a multiple of 8. This is
a requirement for \fIx265\fR, \fIkvazaar\fR, \fItheora\fR, \fIvp8\fR and
\fIvp9\fR video encoders. For \fIx264\fR, \fIh264_nvenc\fR and \fIhevc_nvenc\fR
video encoders this is actually not required, but it will avoid speedloss with
them.
.PP
default: 640x480
.RE
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-position\fR=\fIN\fR,\fIN\fR
.RS
The screen position defining from where the recording will take place. These
are X and Y offsets from the screen top left corner. Combined with \fB\-s\fR
option it will define a rectangular desktop area that will be recorded. This
rectangular area must be inside of the current screen size/resolution (cannot
be out of screen bounds).
.PP
default: 0,0 (screen top left corner)
.RE
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-select-region\fR
.RS
Select with mouse the screen region to record. Use a single mouse click to
select an entire window. Click and drag with mouse to select a region. When
dragging, use the arrow keys to fine tune. Right click or any other keystroke
to cancel. The \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-p\fR options cannot be used with this option.
.PP
The selected width and height must be a multiple of 8 (please see the \fB\-s\fR
option for details). It\'s hard to select a screen region that matches this
need with the currently used tool. To overcome this, if the width and height of
the selected region does not meet this requirement they will be automatically
changed to the immediately higher number that comply with this criteria. Note
that if these newly changed values are out of screen bounds \fBscreencast\fR
will not be able to record and will exit with error.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-fps\fR=\fIN\fR
.RS
Video framerate (frames per second - fps).
.PP
default: 25
.RE
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR=\fITYPE\fR
.RS
Container format of the output video. This option can be used only with the
\fB\-u\fR option (if you want to specify a container format when using
automatic output filename choosing). This option cannot be used when entering
an output filename. When not using the \fB\-u\fR option, the container format
needs to be specified directly in the output filename.
.PP
.nf
        default: mp4
supported types: mp4, mov, mkv, webm, ogg, ogv, flv, nut, wmv, asf, avi
.fi
.RE
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-audio\-input\fR=\fINAME\fR
.RS
ALSA audio input device name. Make sure to have a working ALSA configuration,
for example, by having a properly configured \fI~/.asoundrc\fR file. To
determine possible audio input device names please see:
.nf
<https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Capture/ALSA>
.fi
.PP
Some special values that can be used:
.RS
.PP
\fInone\fR: audio will be disabled (video without audio, only video stream will
be present)
.PP
\fIdefault\fR: the default ALSA device
.PP
\fIpulse\fR: the default PulseAudio device
.RE
.PP
default: default
.PP
\fBnote:\fR the default audio recording backend used by \fBscreencast\fR is
ALSA. If your FFmpeg build has no support for ALSA, it will fallback to use
the PulseAudio backend (a warning message will be displayed), and in this case
you can use this option to specify a PulseAudio input source name. To
determine possible PulseAudio input source names you can use the \fBpactl\fR
utility (\'$ \fBpactl list sources\fR\').
.RE
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-audio\-encoder\fR=\fINAME\fR
.RS
Audio encoder that will be used to encode the recorded audio. When setted to
\fInone\fR the audio will be disabled (video without audio, only video stream
will be present).
.PP
.nf
        default: aac
supported types: aac, opus, vorbis, mp3lame, shine, wma, none
.fi
.RE
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-video\-encoder\fR=\fINAME\fR
.RS
Video encoder that will be used to encode the recorded video. If using a
hardware accelerated video encoder please make sure that you have a graphics
card that supports the specified encoder. Note that hardware accelerated video
encoders have additional requirements: NVENC requires NVIDIA drivers to be
installed, VAAPI requires libva and libdrm to be installed and QSV requires
Intel Media SDK to be installed.
.PP
.nf
        default: x264
supported types: x264, h264_nvenc, h264_vaapi, h264_qsv,

.fi
.RE
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-vaapi\-device\fR=\fINODE\fR
.RS
DRM render node (VAAPI device) that will be used to encode the recorded video.
This option can be used only when specifying a VAAPI hardware accelerated
video encoder with the the \fB\-v\fR option and cannot be used when selecting
other video encoders. Please make sure that the specified DRM render node is
the right one.
.PP
default: /dev/dri/renderD128
.RE
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-fade\fR=\fITYPE\fR
.RS
Enable video fade effect, setting the fade type to \fITYPE\fR. When setted to
\fInone\fR the recorded video will have no fade effect.
.PP
.nf
        default: none
supported types: in, out, both, none
.fi
.RE
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-volume\-factor\fR=\fIN\fR
.RS
Volume increase effect factor. This will increase the volume of the recorded
audio. Usually, audio volume is low with default settings, even if you
increse your microphone capture volume. Use this to give your videos a better
hearing experience, letting your viewers fell more confortable to watch it
whithout needing to rise their sound volume.
.PP
It works as a percentage factor. For example, a value of \fI1.5\fR will
increase volume by 50% and a value of \fI2.0\fR will double volume. It is also
possible to set a volume decrease effect, although this is not recommended
since for this you can simply decrease your microphone recording volume
(for example, a value of \fI0.5\fR will decrease volume by 50%).
.PP
This option can be used only when the \fB\-i\fR and \fB\-a\fR options are not
setted to \fInone\fR. When setted to \fI1.0\fR or \fI0.0\fR this effect is
disabled.
.PP
default: 1.0 (disabled)
.RE
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-watermark\fR=\fITEXT\fR

.PP
When not using the \fB\-x\fR option press the \fIq\fR key in terminal window to

.SH REQUIREMENTS
The minimum requirements are a POSIX-compatible shell, a running X session, a
recent \fIFFmpeg\fR version and \fIxdpyinfo\fR. It\'s advised to use
\fIFFmpeg\fR version git master. \fIFFmpeg\fR needs to be compiled with support
for x11grab (libxcb) and the desired encoders and muxers. When recording
offline, \fIFFmpeg\fR needs to be compiled with support for ffv1 encoder, ffv1
decoder and matroska muxer (\fBscreencast\fR will try to auto-fallback to
ffvhuff or huffyuv encoder/decoder if ffv1 is not supported and to nut muxer
if matroska is not supported, but ffv1 and matroska are preferred). When live
streaming, *FFmpeg* needs to compiled with support for flv muxer.
.PP
When recording audio (\fB\-i\fR and \fB\-a\fR options not setted to
\fInone\fR), \fIFFmpeg\fR must have been compiled with support for ALSA
demuxer (\fBscreencast\fR will try to auto-fallback to PulseAudio demuxer if
ALSA is not supported, but ALSA is preferred). \fIarecord\fR (alsa-utils) will
be required for ALSA when specifying a short or long ALSA input device name
with the \fB\-i\fR option. If the PulseAudio demuxer is being used in the
described auto-fallback situation, \fIpactl\fR will be required when
specifying a PulseAudio input source name with with the \fB\-i\fR option. When
using webcam overlay effect (\fB-W\fR option), \fIFFmpeg\fR must have been
compiled with support for Video4Linux2.
.PP
\fInotify\-send\fR (libnotify) is needed for desktop notifications. Note that
desktop notifications are enabled by default. They can be disabled by using
the \fB\-n\fR option, eliminating the need of \fInotify\-send\fR. Running
\fBscreencast\fR in a system without \fInotify\-send\fR and without using the
\fB\-n\fR option will result in error.
.PP
\fBscreencast\fR will try to play a notification sound when the encoding
process is finished. For this, it will use \fIpaplay\fR (from PulseAudio) and
a sound file from the freedesktop sound theme (usually a package called
\fIsound-theme-freedesktop\fR in most Linux distributions). Although not a
requirement, they are recommended to be installed for a better user experience.
.PP
Other requirements are needed according to additional options that may be
specified by the user:
.RS
.PP
\fIslop\fR is needed for selecting the screen region with mouse
(\fB\-S\fR option).
.PP
\fIFFprobe\fR and \fIbc\fR are needed for video fade effect (\fB\-e\fR option).
.PP
\fIImageMagick\fR is needed for text watermark effect (\fB\-w\fR option). Both
IM6 and IM7 are supported, but IM7 is preferred.
.PP
At least one supported PNG optimizer and \fIadvdef\fR (advancecomp) are needed
for PNG (watermark) optimization (\fB\-g\fR option).
.RE
.SH REMARKS
\fBscreencast\fR is written in pure POSIX shell code and has been tested in
bash, dash, yash, ksh and zsh.
.PP
When recording offline, \fBscreencast\fR uses a two step process. Firstly the
audio and video are recorded to a lossless format, and at a second stage it is
encoded to produce the output video. That\'s why you see a desktop notification
saying \'encoding...\'. This mechanism produces a better video, avoids problems
and allows to use fade effect. When live streaming, \fBscreencast\fR uses a one
step process, with recording and encoding at the same time.
.PP
When using \fIaac\fR audio encoder (which is the default setting),
\fBscreencast\fR will check if the detected FFmpeg build has support for
libfdk_aac and use it if present, otherwise it will use the FFmpeg built\-in
AAC audio encoder. Make sure to have a recent FFmpeg version as older versions
do not support the built\-in AAC audio encoder without being experimental, or
do not support it at all.
.PP
FFmpeg encoder names have the \'lib\' prefix removed for simplicity. For
example, libx264 is called \fIx264\fR in this program.
.PP
For vorbis and opus audio, FFmpeg has both an external library encoder (named
\'libvorbis\' and \'libopus\' encoders) and a native built-in encoder (named
\'vorbis\' and \'opus\' encoders). Although the \fIvorbis\fR and \fIopus\fR
audio encoders are mentioned in the options, it is made this way just for
simplicity as stated right above. When the user selects the \fIvorbis\fR or
\fIopus\fR audio encoder, \fBscreencast\fR uses respectively the FFmpeg
libvorbis or libopus encoder, which has a much superior quality than the FFmpeg
native built\-in vorbis and opus encoders.
.PP
The \fImkv\fR container format is the only one that supports a combinantion of
all audio and video encoders. All other container formats have restrictions.
\fBscreencast\fR will exit with error if an unsupported encoder is chosen for
a given container format. For example, you cannot use the \fIopus\fR audio
encoder with \fImp4\fR container format.
.PP
When using the \fImp4\fR container format, the moov atom will be automatically
moved to the beginning of the output video file. This is the same as running
\fIqt-faststart\fR in the output video and is useful for uploading to
streaming websites like \fIYouTube\fR.
.PP
The default settings for container format and audio/video encoders will produce
a video that is ready to be uploaded to \fIYouTube\fR.
.SH LIMITATIONS
\fBscreencast\fR currently records only display \fI0\fR and screen \fI0\fR
(\fIDISPLAY\fR value of \fI:0.0\fR \- or \fI:0\fR), which is sufficient for
single monitor environments. It may not produce the expected results when using
a multi\-monitor environment depending on your settings.
.PP
It has been reported that \fBscreencast\fR does not work under Wayland.
.SH BUGS
None are known at the moment.
