- fix: broken pipe message with the 'tr' utility when generating a random string
- tests: use less restrictive encoders
- tests: allow to run tests without audio input (AUDIOIN='none')
- tests: allow to run tests in a user defined X server display through the USEDISPLAY environment variable
- tests: allow to set the font for text watermark through the WMARK_FONT environment variable
