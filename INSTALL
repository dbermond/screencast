### Installation instructions

**screencast** is a POSIX-compliant shell script, so thre is nothing to build
in terms of binary files.

But the source code is splitted in modules for easy maintenance. The final
program is intented to be a single script file, instead of a main script that
loads the modules. This allows an easier development, deployment, testing,
debugging, installation and redistribution.

Being such, the script needs to be "built" from the modules in order to create
the intended final program. A Makefile is provided for this. A simple
installation procedure would be:
```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

The provided Makefile supports the `DESTDIR` variable for staged
installations. Other common variables are also supported for the `install`
target, like `PREFIX`, `BINDIR`, `DOCDIR` and `MANDIR`. Bash-completion
directory can be changed with the `BCOMPDIR` variable. For example:
```
$ make
$ sudo make \
         DESTDIR='./pkg' \
         PREFIX='/usr' \
         BCOMPDIR='/usr/share/bash-completion/completions' \
         install
```

### Uninstall

Use the make `uninstall` target. It also supports the same variables of the
`install` target. For proper uninstallation, these variables must be used
with the same values used in the `install` target.

### Tests

**screencast** tests can be performed with the make `check` or `test` targets.
These targets supports the following environment variables:

- `AUDIOIN`: select the audio input device for tests
- `WEBCAM`: include webcam tests, using the specified webcam input device
- `VAAPI`: include VAAPI tests, using the specified DRM render node
- `USEDISPLAY`: select the X server display and screen to run the tests on
- `USESHELL`: use the specified shell to perform the tests (the special value
`all` will perfom tests with the shells bash, dash, yash, ksh, and zsh)

Test example:
```
$ make \
    AUDIOIN='pulse' \
    WEBCAM='/dev/video0' \
    VAAPI='/dev/dri/renderD129' \
    USEDISPLAY=':71.0' \
    USESHELL='all' \
    test
```
